* The minimum requirement for a WordPress Multisite solution is oik version 1.12.1     

* In order to allow you to change the default slideshow behaviour I needed to add some new functions to oik
* Rather than make the functions pluggable I decided it was better to improve the plugin dependency logic
* So version 1.2 is now dependent upon oik version 1.12
* If you have oik version 1.11 or earlier then the plugin will activate and issue warning messages
* BUT it will not work!
* If you are installing into a WordPress MultiSite environment oik version 1.2.1 is needed
  
= 1.0 =
* first version works with oik version 1.11
